# 1. Why choose docker to control Franka Robots
Docker is a containerization platform widely adopted in software development and deployment. It ensures consistency across environments by encapsulating applications and dependencies, offers isolation for independent running containers, and promotes portability between different systems. Docker enhances efficiency with lightweight containers, enables version control for application environments, and supports seamless integration into DevOps practices for continuous integration and deployment. Its scalability, resource efficiency, and ability to define dependencies in Dockerfiles make it a popular choice, simplifying development workflows and fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.
